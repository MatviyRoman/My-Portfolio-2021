Create file from command line
by SRINI
We can create files from command line in two ways. The first way is to use fsutil command and the other way is to use echo command. If you want to write any specific data in the file then use echo command. If you are not bothered about the data in the file but just want to create a file of some specific size then you can use fsutil command.

To create file using echo
echo some-text  > filename.txt
Example:


 
C:\>echo This is a sample text file > sample.txt
C:\>type sample.txt
This is a sample text file
C:\>
To create file using fsutil
fsutil file createnew filename number_of_bytes
Example:

C:\data>fsutil file createnew sample2.txt 2000
File C:\data\sample2.txt is created
C:\data>dir
01/23/2016  09:34 PM     2,000 sample2.txt
C:\data>
Limitations
Fsutil can be used only by administrators. For non-admin users it throws up below error.

c:\>fsutil file /?
The FSUTIL utility requires that you have administrative privileges.
